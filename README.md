# Term-Deposit-Predictive-Model
Implementation of a machine learning algorithm to predict if a customer to a bank will subscribe to term deposit.

### Goal
The goal of such a model will be to increase the efficiency of a marketing campaign by identifying the factors that have the greatest influence on the campaign and predicting whether the campaign will be successful to a particular customer of the bank. 

### Dataset
1) The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a bank. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
2) This data analytics project was carried out using a bank dataset of 15,111 non-duplicate instances with 16 attributes.
3) Of these attributes, 9 were categorical and the remaining 7 were numerical.
4) The target or class is the subscribed column which shows the outcome of the campaign with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ hence, the predictor variable showing if a client subscribed for a term deposit or not.

### Result
The accuracy score indicated a 96.9% accuracy which is viewed as a very good accuracy score. The accuracy is computed by comparing the predicted values to the actual test values
From the Classification report, the recall and precision all show a 97%.
